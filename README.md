# Registration Form App

The Registration Form App is a user-friendly mobile application that simplifies the process of collecting and managing user information. It is designed for a variety of use cases, such as event registrations, membership sign-ups, and more.

## Key Features

### 1. User Registration

- **Name**: Users can enter their full name to register.
- **Date of Birth (DOB)**: The app provides a date picker for users to select their date of birth.
- **Email Address**: Users can enter their email address for communication.

### 2. Multiple Registrations

- Users have the flexibility to add multiple registrations, making it suitable for events or group sign-ups.
- Each registration is stored independently, allowing users to manage multiple entries.

### 3. Duplicate Email Prevention

- The app checks the email address entered by users to prevent duplicate registrations.
- If an email address is already registered, the app notifies the user and prevents duplication.

### 4. Registration Deletion

- Users can easily delete individual registrations they have added.
- Deletion is a straightforward process, enhancing user control.

### 5. Data Storage

- User registration data is securely stored in an SQLite database on the device.
- This ensures data privacy and accessibility even without an internet connection.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: The app is built using the Flutter framework, providing a cross-platform experience on both iOS and Android devices.
- **SQLite Database**: Registration data is managed and stored efficiently using SQLite, a reliable and lightweight database system.
